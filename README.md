# Java Learning Journey

## About This Repository

This is my personal space for learning Java programming. I'm documenting my progress from beginner to proficient developer through university coursework and personal projects.

## 🚀 Featured University Projects

### ✈️ Air Cargo Cost Estimation System
**Location:** `university-work/aircargo-system/`

A comprehensive Java application that calculates air cargo shipping costs with the following features:
- **Weight-based pricing tiers** (Small packages, Larger shipments, Bulk shipments)
- **Cargo type multipliers** (Normal, Perishable, Dangerous)
- **Distance surcharges** for long-distance shipments
- **Additional handling and fuel charges**
- **Interactive user input** with cost summary display

**Technologies:** Java, Scanner class, DecimalFormat, Control Structures
**Concepts Practiced:** Conditional logic, mathematical calculations, user input handling, string manipulation

## Current Focus

- Learning Java OOP concepts in university
